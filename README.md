# 🛒  Expense Tracker  

A **simple and smart expense tracker** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** — with real-time prices fetched from the [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com).

🌟 Overview

This project was built to practice JavaScript fundamentals — APIs, DOM manipulation, and browser storage — while also focusing on clean UI design and a smooth user experience.

It’s lightweight, interactive, and works right inside your browser — no database, no backend, just logic and local persistence.
